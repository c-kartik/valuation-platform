## Project

Automated Equity Valuation Platform.

The application will accept a US stock ticker, retrieve and normalize historical financial data primarily from SEC EDGAR/XBRL, accept manual forecast assumptions, and calculate an FCFF DCF.

Initial scope is US-listed non-financial companies.

## Current Phase

Build the Python SEC/XBRL historical financial data pipeline:

Ticker → CIK → SEC EDGAR → XBRL / Company Facts → period selection → financial normalization → standardized Python output.

Start with META. After META is reliable, validate against GOOGL, MSFT, and AAPL.

Do not implement valuation UI or deployment infrastructure yet.

## Engineering Principles

- Prioritize correctness, modularity, explainability, and testability.
- Build incrementally; do not implement the entire application at once.
- Keep SEC retrieval, XBRL normalization, derived financial calculations, and valuation calculations separate.
- Prefer official SEC data for historical financials.
- Never invent missing financial values.
- Preserve source metadata so normalized values can be traced back to SEC filings.
- Avoid premature infrastructure such as databases, caching, containers, authentication, or cloud services unless clearly required.
- Add tests for financial calculations and important normalization logic.

## Financial Methodology

Historical standardized output should eventually support:

- Revenue
- EBIT / operating income
- Taxes
- D&A
- Capex
- Operating NWC and change in NWC
- Cash and investments
- Debt
- Diluted shares
- Other inputs required for FCFF valuation

Core FCFF relationship:

FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - Capex - Change in NWC

where:

NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - tax rate)

Forecast assumptions will initially be entered manually.

## Repository Documentation

Keep these files current when relevant decisions are made:

- `README.md` — project overview, setup, and usage
- `docs/architecture.md` — architecture and technical decisions
- `docs/financial-methodology.md` — financial definitions and methodology
- `docs/project-status.md` — completed work, current milestone, known issues, and next steps

Repository documentation is the source of truth for project state and decisions.

## Development Workflow

For each milestone:

1. Define what is being built and why.
2. Implement the smallest working version.
3. Add or update tests.
4. Run tests locally.
5. Validate financial outputs against actual SEC filings when applicable.
6. Update documentation when architecture, methodology, or project status changes.
7. Commit a coherent unit of work.

Do not silently change financial definitions or architecture decisions. Document material changes.
