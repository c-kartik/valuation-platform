# Project Status

## Current Milestone

Phase 1E is complete. The next milestone is Phase 1F financial normalization
and concept mapping.

## Completed

- Completed Milestone 0 — development environment and repository setup
- Created GitHub repository
- Cloned repository locally
- Connected local repository to GitHub remote
- Configured Git identity
- Set up Python 3.12 virtual environment
- Configured VS Code to use the project virtual environment
- Created initial repository structure
- Created initial project documentation
- Added a reusable SEC JSON HTTP client with identifying User-Agent support
- Added exact ticker → SEC company identity resolution using the official SEC
  `company_tickers.json` dataset
- Added deterministic unit tests for SEC transport and ticker resolution
- Added typed recent-filing metadata retrieval from the official SEC
  Submissions API
- Added explicit validation for SEC parallel-array structure, required fields,
  and filing dates
- Added deterministic unit tests for submissions retrieval and parsing
- Added typed metadata for supplemental SEC submissions history files
- Added explicit, on-demand retrieval and shared parsing for individual
  supplemental history files
- Added deterministic unit tests for supplemental metadata and retrieval
- Added a pure, deterministic selector for exact 10-K annual periods and exact
  10-Q filings after the latest selected annual period
- Added incremental history orchestration that stops retrieving supplemental
  files as soon as the requested annual coverage is available
- Added explicit ambiguity handling for duplicate reporting periods
- Added deterministic unit tests for selection and orchestration
- Added complete Company Facts retrieval through the existing SEC client
- Added immutable models for concepts and unit-tagged fact observations
- Added explicit Company Facts validation while preserving optional context,
  observation ordering, and repeated comparative facts
- Added deterministic unit tests for Company Facts parsing and errors
- Added a development-only cross-company Company Facts validation harness that
  uses the production SEC APIs sequentially, reports per-stage failures without
  stopping the run, and defaults to a repeatable 20-company corpus
- Validated Company Facts across all 20 corpus companies: 11,181 concepts and
  528,990 observations parsed with no failures
- Added narrowly validated canonical decimal-string CIK support after XOM
  exposed that live SEC representation, with mismatch regression coverage
- Added pure Company Facts observation selection anchored to selected filing
  accessions, preserving annual/interim grouping and deterministic ordering
- Added structural current, comparative, and after-report-date relationships,
  plus instant/duration classification without YTD or discrete-quarter inference
- Added explicit exact-observation ambiguity handling while preserving
  same-end/different-start periods, multiple units, and legitimate absence
- Added compact selection output that retains only matched observations and
  Company Facts source metadata rather than the full parsed observation graph
- Added deterministic tests for calendar, non-calendar, 52/53-week, and interim
  period shapes, ambiguity, absence, provenance, ordering, and ownership

## Next Step

Begin Phase 1F financial normalization and concept mapping. Authoritative
financial concepts, concept fallbacks, derived quarters, and standardized
financial fields are not implemented yet.
