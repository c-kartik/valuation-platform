# Financial Methodology

## Purpose

This document defines the financial concepts and calculation methodology used by the valuation platform.

Financial definitions should remain consistent across SEC normalization, historical analysis, forecasting, and valuation.

## Historical Financials

Historical financial data should primarily come from official SEC EDGAR/XBRL filings.

The standardized historical schema should eventually include:

- Revenue
- EBIT / operating income
- Taxes
- Depreciation & amortization
- Capital expenditures
- Operating net working capital
- Change in operating net working capital
- Cash and investments
- Debt
- Diluted shares outstanding

Exact XBRL concept mappings will be documented as the SEC normalization pipeline is developed and validated.

## Source vs. Derived Values

Values obtained directly from SEC filings should remain distinguishable from values calculated by the platform.

Each normalized value should preserve sufficient metadata to identify its source, including where applicable:

- XBRL concept
- Filing/accession
- Fiscal period
- Form type
- Filing date
- Unit

Derived values should record the calculation used to produce them.

Missing values must not be silently invented.

## FCFF

The core valuation methodology is unlevered free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).

```text
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)

FCFF = NOPAT
       + D&A
       - Capital Expenditures
       - Change in Operating NWC
