# Financial Methodology

## Purpose

This document defines the financial concepts and calculation methodology used by the valuation platform.

Financial definitions should remain consistent across SEC normalization, historical analysis, forecasting, and valuation.

## Historical Financials

Historical financial data should primarily come from official SEC EDGAR/XBRL filings.

The standardized historical schema should eventually include:

- Revenue
- EBIT / operating income
- Taxes
- Depreciation & amortization
- Capital expenditures
- Operating net working capital
- Change in operating net working capital
- Cash and investments
- Debt
- Diluted shares outstanding

Exact XBRL concept mappings will be documented as the SEC normalization pipeline is developed and validated.

### Initial Annual Revenue and Operating Income Normalization

The initial normalization scope covers direct annual Revenue and Operating
Income values from selected exact 10-K filings. It does not cover interim
normalization or derived quarters.

Revenue uses this ordered candidate policy:

1. `us-gaap:RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax`
2. `us-gaap:Revenues`

Operating Income currently uses:

1. `us-gaap:OperatingIncomeLoss`

These policies were validated against five annual periods each for META,
GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, and COST. They are an initial evidence-based policy, not a
claim of universal issuer coverage. `us-gaap:SalesRevenueNet` and issuer
extensions are intentionally excluded pending selected-filing evidence.

An annual candidate must be a numeric, exact-USD, current duration whose end
date equals the selected 10-K report date. The SEC observation's actual start
and end dates define the economic period; normalization does not assume calendar
years or 365/366-day durations.

The highest-priority concept with a valid annual observation is selected. A
lower-priority concept is used only when higher-priority concepts lack a valid
observation for that period. Equal values from another configured concept with
the same unit, start, and end are retained as confirming provenance. Conflicting
same-period USD values or multiple valid USD starts remain explicitly ambiguous
rather than being selected silently. Non-USD observations are unsupported in
this slice and do not participate when a valid USD candidate exists; if no
valid USD candidate exists, the metric is missing.

## Source vs. Derived Values

Values obtained directly from SEC filings should remain distinguishable from values calculated by the platform.

Each normalized value should preserve sufficient metadata to identify its source, including where applicable:

- XBRL concept
- Filing/accession
- Fiscal period
- Form type
- Filing date
- Unit

Derived values should record the calculation used to produce them.

Missing values must not be silently invented.

## FCFF

The core valuation methodology is unlevered free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).

```text
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)

FCFF = NOPAT
       + D&A
       - Capital Expenditures
       - Change in Operating NWC
